The Django API uses Django REST Framework for its browsability and ease of use when developing CRUD endpoints.  It uses django's default SQLite database, and pulls the data from the /data directory.

# Development using Django Server
To do any python development on the django application itself, I would suggest using django's built-in server as it allows for various things (such as debug mode and quick reloads).  Here's the general process for getting that up and running.

First, install pipenv from here (https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

Once pipenv is installed locally, you can then use it to install of the project dependencies defined in the Pipfile.
> pipenv install

## Quick Setup
If you want to work with existing data sources and just get working you can quickly stand up the server with

> pipenv run python manage.py quicksetup

followed by

> pipenv run python manage.py runserver

This will stand up the server with full content and search index at http://localhost:8000.

## Manual Setup Steps
If you want to customize your setup, particularly useful if adding new content sources, then you will need to use the built-in django migration function to define your database, making sure to run it within the pipenv environment.
> pipenv run python manage.py migrate

You will then need to collect the static files (this makes django-resk-framework look presentable when viewing it in html).
> pipenv run python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

Finally, you will need to load the SRD data from the json files in the /data folder.  This is using the custom populatedb command.
> pipenv run python manage.py populatedb --flush ./data/WOTC_5e_SRD_v5.1/

At that point, you will be able to run the django server normally (within the pipenv environment).
> pipenv run python manage.py runserver

And your server should be available at http://localhost:8000.
